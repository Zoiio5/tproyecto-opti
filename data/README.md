# README for the Data Directory

This directory contains the data files used in the MiniZinc project. The data files are generated by the `generador.py` script and are essential for running the MiniZinc model defined in `pipeline.mzn`.

The generated data files will be located in the `instancias_minizinc/` directory, and the results from the MiniZinc model runs will be saved in the `resultados/` directory.

Please ensure that the data files are properly generated before running the MiniZinc model.
